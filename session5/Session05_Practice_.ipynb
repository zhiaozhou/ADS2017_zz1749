On the other hand, $R^2=0$ means that the model always predicts the sample mean $\\overline{y}$, i.e. explaining variables $x$ have no effect on responce variable $y$. \n",

    "of having a $z$ randomly produced by the distribution corresponding to the null-hypothesis value $w_j=w_j^0$ with even higher $|z|$ compared to the observed $|t|$. This can be interpreted as a likelihood that the observed value of $t$ is got just by chance given $w_j=w_j^0$. If this likelihood is lower than a certain threshold value (usually $5\\%$) this is interpreted as having an equation $w_j=w_j^0$ too unlikely, i.e. having to reject the hypothesis $H_0$. Otherwise, if $p-value$ is higher than a threshold value ($>5\\%$) this means that the null-hypothesis can not be rejected with sufficient confidence (of at least $95\\%$) so this might be the case that the regressor does not have a significant impact. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand that $p$-value is not supposed to prove any specific estimate for the coefficient $w_j$ - it can only make us confident (or uncertain on the contrary) that $w_j\\neq 0$ (or different from another value of interest). Also having a low $p$-values do not prove that the impact of $x_i$ on $y$ is actually linear. In turn, having high $p$-value by itself does not prove that $y$ is independent on $x_i$ (first of all - a linear impact could still be there despite being seen as unlikely, just disguised by noise; second - the actual impact could be non-linear, i.e. not subject to being described by a linear model; third - an impact of the considered regressor might be affected by an overlap with the impact of the other regressors, so it might not be impactful after others are considered, but it might still be impactful by itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regressors having high $p$-values are usually not included into the final model in order to stay free from the random insignificnt effects, reducing the risk of overfitting. This is however not the only way of fighting it. Also sequentually excluding regressors based on their $p$-values is not necessarily the best way of the feature selection as high $p$-values might result from multicollinearity, i.e. from having an impact of the considered regressor overlap with the impact of others. And it might happen that excluding other regressors in the first place will better help with fighting the overfitting and also might lead to the decrease of the $p$-values of the remaining regressors as a result.\n",

The following $F$-statistics helps with that:\n",

    "F=\\frac{(RSS_0-RSS_1)(N-n)}{RSS_1\\cdot (n-m)},\n",
    "$$\n",

If we only consider a cumulative impact of all the regressors vs a trivial regression having just the intercept, then $m-1$ and $F$-statitics could be expressed through $R^2$:\n",
